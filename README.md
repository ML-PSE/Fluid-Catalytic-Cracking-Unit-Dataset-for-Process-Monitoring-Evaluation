# Fluid catalytic cracking unit dataset for evaluation of process monitoring techniques

## What the repository is about?
The PDStoolkit (Process Data Science Toolkit) package has been created to provide easy-to-use modules to help quickly build data-based solutions for process systems such as those for process monitoring, modeling, fault diagnosis, system identification, etc. Current modules in the package are wrappers around pre-existing Sklearn's classes and provide several additional methods to facilitate a process data scientist's job. Details on these are provided in the following section. More modules relevant for process data science will be added over time.
